==============================================
Dell Display Manager
===============================================

Automatic install/uninstall.

32/64-bit OS support:
Windows 10
Windows 8
Windows 7
Windows Vista

Requires one or more Dell DDC/CI and asset management 
enabled monitors, and Windows Vista or a newer OS 
with a WHQL display driver that supports DDC/CI. 

Silent Deployment
-----------------------------------------------
To silently deploy Dell Display Manager, start the setup 
program with the "/VerySilent" command-line parameter. To
install silently to a specific folder, add the parameter
"/Dir=FullPathName".

Troubleshooting
-----------------------------------------------
If DDM is unable to detect and/or communicate with
a supported Dell monitor:
- make sure you have the correct and latest display
  driver from the graphics vendor (AMD, Intel, NVidia)
- check the monitor OSD to ensure DDC/CI is enabled
- remove any docking stations or cable extenders or
  converters between the monitor and the graphics port
- with first generation DP 1.2 monitors, it may be 
  necessary to disable MST/DP 1.2 using the monitor OSD
- virtual, wireless, and NVidia G-Sync gaming displays
  do not support DDC/CI and/or DDM

DisplayLink / e-Docks
-----------------------------------------------
USB DisplayLink-based graphics may require version 8.0 
or newer USB Graphics Software from DisplayLink. USB-C
docks may require the latest Intel Thunderbolt3 drivers. 

Auto-rotation
-----------------------------------------------
Auto-rotation is only available on displays with 
supporting firmware, and only applies to changes in 
physical or OSD menu orientation made while Dell Display 
Manager is connected to the monitor.

Input management
-----------------------------------------------
Input management is only available on displays with 
supporting firmware.

Easy Arrange
-----------------------------------------------
Easy Arrange is now available on all display 
models, and while enabled may disable Microsoft Snap
window dragging to minimize feature overlap (Windows 
Snap hotkeys remain enabled). To temporarily disable
Easy Arrange while moving a window, hold down the
Shift key until the move completes. A checkbox is
provided to reverse this default logic.

Auto Mode and Metro/Windows apps
-----------------------------------------------
To associate a Metro/Windows app with a Preset mode, 
open the app on the Windows 10 desktop and drag-and-drop 
the top-left corner of the app window into the Auto Mode 
application list. If Easy Arrange is enabled, it may be 
necessary to hold down the Shift key to temporarily 
disable auto-positioning.

Hotkeys
-----------------------------------------------
With the exception of the input switching hotkeys, which
are unique to each monitor, hotkeys are shared and - where
appropriate - targeted at the monitor the Windows mouse
pointer is on.

Command language
-----------------------------------------------
A rich and flexible command language is supported via the
command-line, and command-line arguments can be combined.
Where appropriate, a specific display can be targeted by
prefacing the command with the monitor serial number or
enumerated display number, e.g., "2:AutoSetup"; if a 
display serial or enumerated number is not specified the
command will be applied to the current selected display
or to all displays, as appropriate. Commands include:
 
SetActiveInput [DVI2/HDMI/DP2,etc] - switches active input
RestoreFactoryDefaults - restores factory defaults*
AutoSetup - executes an autosetup (analog only)*
RestoreLevelDefaults - restores level defaults*
RestoreColorDefaults - restores color defaults*
SetBrightnessLevel X - sets brightness to X% (0-100)*
SetContrastLevel X - sets contrast to X% (0-100)*
SetNamedPreset [Movie/CAL1,etc] - changes the Preset mode*
SetPowerMode [on/off] - sets the display power mode*
SetOptimalResolution - switches to optimal resolution
SaveProfile [Name] - save settings to named profile*
RestoreProfile [Name] - restore settings from named profile*
DeleteProfile [Name] - delete named profile
SetGridType [X] - changes Easy Arrange grid type to X
Rescan - rescans display hardware
ForceReset - reconnects and rescans display hardware
SetControl X Y - sets hex control X to hex value Y
IncControl X Y - increases the value of control X by Y
DecControl X Y - decreases the value of control X by Y
Zoom - switches between PxP and fullscreen mode
Wait X - pause X milliseconds
Exit - terminates the program
 
Some of these commands require familiarity with the MCCS
standard. For example, on monitors that support it the 
command to switch the OSD language to Spanish would be 
"SetControl CC 0A"; to unlock an OSD that has been 
inadvertently locked "SetControl CA 02".

Instructions can be combined on the command-line, and
assigned to standard Windows shortcuts with optional hotkeys
or coupled with the native Windows Task Scheduler to execute at
certain times.

For example:
 
  "ddm.exe /RestoreLevelDefaults /2:SetContrastLevel 70"
 
would first restore level defaults on all monitors, and then
set the contrast level on monitor #2 to 70%. 

NB: If not targeted to a specific monitor, commands listed
above that are tagged with an asterisk (*) apply to all
monitors to facilitate simple and uniform control over all
members of a multimonitor matrix. For instance, if executed
on a matrix of 16 similar monitors, the command-line:
 
  "ddm.exe /SetNamedPreset Warm /SetBrightnessLevel 75"
 
would set all 16 monitors to Warm preset mode, with a
brightness level of 75%.
